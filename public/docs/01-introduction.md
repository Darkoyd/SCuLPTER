# Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Cubic Language for Programming Tasks!

I'm {Darkoyd} and I've written this guide to help you, the dear reader, with SCuLPT!

SCuLPT is a programming language designed for simplicity, accessibility and expressiveness. This documentation will guide you through all aspects of the language.

## What is SCuLPT?

SCuLPT is a programming language and artistic sandbox designed to bridge together computation and aesthetic expression. It offers a simple physical interface made up of several components and this site itself as a formal specification of the language, as well as a functioning development environment and runtime for SCuLPT programs.

### Key Features

I initially built SCuLPT with a strict set of items available to create a programming language from scratch, almost as a challenge to myself as a developer and educator. Simplicity was the main goal here, and I believe SCuLPT achieves that through its unique features:

- **One type to rule them all.** SCuLPT uses only one type of value and one data structure.
- **Physical first** by default.
- **Small instruction set** with only 13 instructions.
- **Accessible and customizable.** Anyone, anywhere can and should code.

### Philosophy

I initially built SCuLPT with a broader set of ideals in mind, almost as a challenge to myself as an artist and educator. Simplicity was not the main goal here, but rather more abstract ideals that I believe programming should embody. SCuLPT is built around the following principles:

1. **Simplicity:** Easy to learn, easy to read, easy to teach, easy to play.
2. **Low-cost:** 3D printable components and open-source software.
3. **Extensibility:** Modular design for easy expansion and customization.
4. **Community-driven:** Open to contributions and feedback from users.
5. **Artistic expression:** Encourages creativity and exploration through programming.

## Who is SCuLPT for?

SCuLPT is ideal for:

- Beginners learning programming concepts
- Educators teaching coding and computational thinking
- Artists and designers exploring computational art
- Hobbyists and makers interested in physical computing
- Anyone curious about programming and creativity
